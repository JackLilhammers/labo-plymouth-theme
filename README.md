# mint-logo-2: A new Plymouth theme for Linux Mint
This is a new version for your animated boot screen. This logo here is twice as large as the standard one. My boot screen is full HD: 1920 X 1080 pixels. In my humble opinion, the standard Mint Plymouth theme looked a bit "cheap", being too small for this full HD screen. It almost felt like there was just a small "dot" displayed there. Now this new logo is double-sized at 200 pixels large. This works best on FHD screens, but i also tested it on my old little netbook, with a 800 X 600 pixels boot screen. On this small netbook this new logo looks a bit big, but it still works.

And this logo is also subtly redesigned with the exact same line widths for both the circle and the LM inside. And, also, the spinning background is made of blue tones and is a bit more contrasted than the standard one.
